Overview

This repository hosts a Streamlit dashboard for analyzing the motor vehicle collision dataset publicly available from New York City. The dashboard provides an interactive interface to explore various aspects of motor vehicle collisions in NYC, including trends over time, locations with the highest frequency of collisions, contributing factors, and more.

Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the New York City Open Data platform. It contains detailed information about motor vehicle collisions reported within the five boroughs of NYC, including date, time, location, contributing factors, vehicle types, and injuries.

Features:

1) Interactive Visualizations: Explore motor vehicle collision data through interactive plots and charts.
2) Temporal Analysis: Examine trends and patterns in collision occurrences over time, such as monthly and hourly variations.
3) Spatial Analysis: Identify hotspots of collisions on the map and analyze collision patterns across different boroughs and neighborhoods.
4) Injury Analysis: Understand the dangerous streets by the number of injured people.


The dashboard can be accessed once created in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.
